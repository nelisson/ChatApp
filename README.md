# README: StockChat - Chat Application with Stock Information


## Overview
Welcome to StockChat! This unique chat application allows users to communicate in real-time and retrieve stock quotes directly within the chatroom. Designed with a focus on back-end technologies using .NET, this application provides an intuitive user experience and efficient real-time data access.

## Features

### Real-time Chatroom
- Chat with multiple users in a real-time chatroom. Share ideas, ask questions, and engage in conversations.
- Messages are ordered by timestamps, and the chatroom displays only the last 50 messages, ensuring a clean and focused conversation.

### Stock Quote Commands
- Use the command `/stock=stock_code` within the chatroom to request stock quotes.
- A decoupled bot retrieves stock quotes from the Stooq API and sends a message back to the chatroom with the quote information.
- Receive stock quote messages in the following format: "APPL.US quote is $93.42 per share." The bot will be credited as the post owner.

### User Authentication
- StockChat employs .NET Identity for user authentication, offering a secure login experience for all users.

### Error Handling
- The chatbot can handle messages that are not understood or any exceptions raised during its operation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
